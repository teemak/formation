‚ùì PROMPT
You open up your computer's downloads folder, looking for that cute video of Oliver barking at the doorbell you downloaded a few weeks ago. Of course, it's mixed in with all of the other silly otter videos and other stuff you just had to save. To make it easier to find, you click on the column to sort the view by date to see the most recent first, at the top.

For this problem, we're going to implement that file system sort by date. The files themselves are represented by objects:

{
  "filename": <string>,
  "size": <number>,
  "date": <string>}

and the date itself is in US format:

MM-DD-YYYY HH:MM:SS

Write a function that sorts an array of these file objects, with the most recent at the top.

Follow-up:
- What happens if a date like 2 Feb 2021 is compared with 12 Nov 2021 and the day and month don't have leading zeros: 2-2-2021? How can the code be modified to handle this?
- If the dates are tied down to the second, add a secondary sort by file name in descending order.

Example(s)
Input: sortFiles([
  {"filename": "otter.mpeg", "size": 512, "date": "01-16-2023 14:23:13"},
  {"filename": "oliver.mp4", "size": 1024, "date": "01-18-2023 12:46:57"},
])

Output: [
  {"filename": "oliver.mp4", "size": 1024, "date": "01-18-2023 12:46:57"},
  {"filename": "otter.mpeg", "size": 512, "date": "01-16-2023 14:23:13"},
]
