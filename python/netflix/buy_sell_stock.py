❓ PROMPT
Given an array of floats that represents the movement in the share price of a company over time, design an algorithm that determines the maximum profit that could have been made by buying and then selling a single share over the time period. The buy must occur before the sell.

Example(s)
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5

Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
*Note: buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.*

Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0

Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done, and the max profit = 0.
